# BallOnPlateTeam8
This is a webpage documenting our MECA 482 semester project

Team: Courtney Boes, Riley Meyer, Justin Price, Frank Silva
# Project Overview
The ball on plate system is an expansion on the popular ball on beam system that is often used for control system projects. A ball is placed on a plate that is controlled in two dimensions typically by servo motors. The servo motors are controlled by either one or multiple PID controllers, with the objective of keeping the ball balanced on the plate. Because of COVID-19 restrictions, we are not going to have a physical implementation of this project. However, the mathematical model and simulation will still be developed and performed.

MATLAB/Simulink is going to be the resource utilized for developing the overall mathematical model for the system. CoppeliaSim will be used to perform the simulation.
